The module 'threads_a_gogo.node' will appear in this folder if everything goes
well (if installed with npm install or node-gyp rebuild). In older nodes
(if the module is installed with node-waf configure build install) it won't,
instead it will appear in .node_libraries (which is an invisible folder).
